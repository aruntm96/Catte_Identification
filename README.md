# Cattle Identification Project

This project focuses on identifying unique patterns in cattle's noses, similar to human fingerprints. The goal is to gather real-time cow muzzle data, process it, and develop a methodology to accurately recognize and differentiate between individual cow nose patterns.

## Project Overview

The project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Real-time cow muzzle images are gathered using specialized equipment or high-resolution cameras.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The collected images undergo preprocessing to remove noise, standardize sizes, and enhance quality, ensuring consistency in the dataset.

3. **Feature Extraction:** The Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm is utilized to extract distinctive features from segmented cow muzzle images.

4. **Feature Encoding:** Unique IDs are generated for the extracted features using the MD5 Hashing algorithm to prevent feature redundancy.

5. **Pattern Matching:** Features from test and training images of the same cow are compared for accurate pattern recognition.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cattle_Identification.git
    ```

2. Use google colab workspace.
   
3. Upload the datasets in the drive, so that ease acces via Google Colab. 

4. Go through the documentation for clear view of the project.
